- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @theangrytech-git. I'm a 41 year old social handgrenade with three children, and a newly-wed but long-suffering wife.

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™ve been working in IT since 2006, but have been involved in it long before I took it up as a job!
- I have worked as:
- 1st, 2nd and 3rd Line Desktop Support Technician
- Server Engineer (Working on Win 2003 to 2019)
- Virtulisation (Re-designing virtual estate from a 'here's everything onto a single VHD' to 'Here's an OS disk, and a data disk....right-sized'
- And during the pandemic of 2020, I started to get more involved with Autopilot/Intune
- Prior to this, I've been working in Finance, Accounts, Baking, a limited run as a butcher, and an Army Reservist for just short of a decade.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working as an Advanced Operations Engineer for one of the major Top 5 Cloud Consultancy in the UK, working mainly in Azure
- I am a certified Azure Administrator, an Azure Solutions Architect, and an Azure Security Engineer Associate, as well as an AWS Solutions Architect.
- I am currently expanding my knowledge of Terraform and getting used to using Github more

- ðŸ“« How to reach me?
- Either on here

- ðŸ˜„ What do I have in mind for the future?
- Once I've finished my AZ-104 Training Environment, I plan to:
- Create an Azure Fundamental Training package
- Create some AZ-104, AZ-305 course content and labs
- Look at doing the same for AWS
- Create some course content and slap it onto Youtube (https://www.youtube.com/@TheAngryTech-YT)
- Look at creating some Projects to host on here and a mini-course on how to create them
- Look into doing some deep-dives on technologies
 
- âš¡ Fun fact:
- There are more planes in the sea than there are boats in the air
